# Django Notes App

A simple yet effective web-based note-taking application built with the Django framework. This application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete their personal notes in an organized manner.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended)
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Git (for cloning the repository)
*   A virtual environment (Recommended to create a virtual environment for this project)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/talha-shafique/Django-Notes-App.git
    cd Django-Notes-App
    ```
2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    Navigate to your project directory (`Django-Notes-App` or `notes`) if you're not already there.

    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    After activation, your command prompt should be prefixed with `(.venv)`.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    This command creates the necessary database tables based on your Django models.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a Superuser (Administrator):**
    This allows you to access the Django admin interface.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set a username, email (optional), and password.

6.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Start the Django development server.
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

7.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    *   **Main Application:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
    *   **Admin Interface:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` (Log in with the superuser credentials you created).
